 egyptA2_title:0 "Rebuild The Port Of Alexandria"
 egyptA2_desc:0 "Since its founding by Alexander the Great, the great port city of Alexandria has been vital to our country. It is time to rebuild the city in the image of Alexander himself."
 egyptA3_title:0 "Grow The Breadbasket"
 egyptA3_desc:0 "The fertile land of the Nile has over time become the breadbasket of the Mediterranean, with countries across the sea relying on regular shipments leaving from Alexandria. To boost our economy further, the production of grain must be further increased."
 egyptA4_title:0 "Develop The West"
 egyptA4_desc:0 "With Alexandria dominating the western Egypt area this land has been left underdeveloped. To increase the power of our country and the lives of our citizens on the periphery, we must focus on the west."
 egyptB1_title:0 "Desert Paradise"
 egyptB1_desc:0 "The Deserts to the west of the Nile are seen as unforgiving wastelands, unworthy of our attention. However, these harsh lands have beautiful oasis’, that, if developed properly, have the potential to give birth to new oasis cities."
 egyptB2_title:0 "Develop The Nile Valley"
 egyptB2_desc:0 "The Nile valley is home to the majority of our population and makes up the heartland of our nation. We need to invest here to unlock the potential of the Nile River."
 egyptB3_title:0 "Industrialise Central Egypt"
 egyptB3_desc:0 "Central Egypt is home to several provinces that, if industrialised, can manufacture large amounts of quality goods that our merchants sell on at great profit to our country. It is vital to our economy that we begin the process of industrialisation as soon as possible."
 egyptB4_title:0 "Valley of The Kings"
 egyptB4_desc:0 "Located just outside the ancient city of Luxor is the Valley of the Kings. A sacred burial site for ancient Pharaohs and noble men alike. The city itself has become a hub of rich nobles, academics, and tourists alike. If we are to truly embrace our history, the ancient city must be restored to its former glory."
 egyptB5_title:0 "Reform the Economy"
 egyptB5_desc:0 "Some have foolishly declared that the best way to run a country is to exploit the tax base for short term gain. The reforms to our economy will show these people the error of their ways!"
 egyptC1_title:0 "Fortify The Sinai Pass"
 egyptC1_desc:0 "The rich heartland of Egypt is made up of flatlands and farms. To best defend ourselves we need to take advantage of our natural defences; the Sinai hills are the perfect place for an impenetrable fort."
 egyptC2_title:0 "Red Sea Ports"
 egyptC2_desc:0 "Historically, the Asian trade has travelled overland along well travelled routes before arriving in our land. However, the development of sea trade has left us at a disadvantage. To compete we must embrace these new trade routes and build Red Sea Ports to accommodate for this trade."
 egyptC3_title:0 "Rebuild The Ibrim Fort"
 egyptC3_desc:0 "The city of Ibrim was built around a magnificent fort that over time has fallen into ruin. To protect our Southern border, is it vital that we rebuild this fort to its former glory."
 egyptC4_title:0 "Fortify The Western Front"
 egyptC4_desc:0 "The western part of Egypt is somewhat of a backdoor into the heart of our nation, with nothing stopping invaders from marching straight onto Alexandria. We must fortify this region and create a fort network in the unforgiving desert."
 egyptC5_title:0 "The Egyptian Army"
 egyptC5_desc:0 "The time and effort we have put into building a large and professional army has paid off. We now possess an army capable of competing with the very best."

 egyptD3_title:0 "Red Sea Dominance"
 egyptD3_desc:0 "Our Red Sea ports have helped us increase our reach in the Asian Trade. We must now subjugate our competitors in the area to secure our dominance."
 egyptD4_title:0 "A Professional Army"
 egyptD4_desc:0 "To protect our nation, we need a professional and well drilled standing army, capable of fending off even the fiercest of rivals."
 egyptE1_title:0 "The Ottomans"
 egyptE1_desc:0 "The Turkish menace believe themselves to be our superiors. Of course this is a laughable idea, and we must make sure they know it is too."
 egyptE2_title:0 "Auxiliary Soldiers"
 egyptE2_desc:0 "While we appreciate our vassals financial contributions, why should Egyptian men die to protect them? They must provide their fair share of men to the defence of the nation." 
 egyptE3_title:0 "Maghreb Relations"
 egyptE3_desc:0 "Politically, we are in a precocious position, potential enemies surround us in the North, East, and South. But those pirates in the West seem nice enough, we should be friends with them."
 egyptE4_title:0 "Build a Mediterranean Fleet"
 egyptE4_desc:0 "If we ever come to blows with the Turks, we must be ready to cross the Bosphorus if required. This requires a sizeable fleet, well, at least bigger than the Ottomans that is."
 egyptE5_title:0 "Reclaim Our Heratige"
 egyptE5_desc:0 "We have so far put a great deal of effort into reverting our country back to past glory. However, we must continue this and propagate Egyptian culture further."
 egyptE6_title:0 "The New Kingdom of Egypt"
 egyptE6_desc:0 "Our nation is almost restored to its previous glory. The only step left is to embark on conquest, as those Pharaohs of the New Kingdom did. We can also now answer the final question."

 senegalA2_title:0 "Expand the Frontier"
 senegalA2_desc:0 "Following the improvement of our core land it is time to look for new opportunities for growth. The land South of us offers great potential for our nation and we should take advantage of it."
 senegalA3_title:0 "Colonise Guinea"
 senegalA3_desc:0 "With the success of our colonisation efforts in Guinea, it only makes sense to continue with this program."
 senegalA4_title:0 "A New Frontier"
 senegalA4_desc:0 "European traders have been spreading rumours of rich and fertile land to be found across the sea. As a seafaring nation it is only right that we explore these rumours and seek out this new world."
 senegalB1_title:0 "Expand Further into the Valley"
 senegalB1_desc:0 "With us now having control of this area it is time to push further inland and explore the valley further."
 senegalB2_title:0 "The Slave Trade"
 senegalB2_desc:0 "Our coastline has become a hotbed of activity amongst European slavers and this has become somewhat of an issue amongst our fellow countrymen. Our nation stands at a crossroads and it is up to us to decide what is best for the nation."
 senegalB3_title:0 "Secure the Local Ivory Trade"
 senegalB3_desc:0 "We are lucky to live in lands that provide us with such luxurious goods to sell. Ivory is particularly in demand by the wealthy foreigners and we are only happy to sell to them."
 senegalB4_title:0 "Dominate the Ivory Trade"
 senegalB4_desc:0 "Our control over the local ivory trade has developed into a worldwide network of customers. However, we have some competition in the market, for now."
 senegalC1_title:0 "Improve the Capital"
 senegalC1_desc:0 "Our capital is starting to become a highly populated area, but unfortunately it is underdeveloped and lacking in infrastructure. We should focus our nation's resources into building a capital that we can be proud of."
 senegalC2_title:0 " Compete in the Ivory Coast"
 senegalC2_desc:0 "In recent times the ivory coast has become a hotbed of trade, with Europeans, Africans, and many others doing business there. We have the potential to carve out a nice little share of the wealth trading hands here."
 senegalC3_title:0 "Acquire Trade Ports"
 senegalC3_desc:0 "Our expansion into the ivory coast has proven to be a huge boon to our economy and has left our new merchant class eager for a bigger share. Our merchants have informed us of several other important ports, which surely would be better under our control?"
 senegalC4_title:0 "Control the Ivory Coast"
 senegalC4_desc:0 "Our forays into the ivory coast have been hugely successful to this point, but why stop here. Now we need to secure our dominance of the trade here and stamp our authority on the ivory coast."
 senegalC5_title:0 "Drive out the Europeans"
 senegalC5_desc:0 "We have had mixed dealings with the European colonial powers up until this point and the time has come to make a final decision on our future relationship with them. Do we cooperate or take steps to protect our sovereignty?"

 senegalD2_title:0 "African Gold"
 senegalD2_desc:0 "We have heard many rumours of gold mines in the interior that are being horribly mismanaged. Administrative and military development!? We must take over the management of these mines and show them how it’s done."
 senegalD3_title:0 "Secure Inland Trade Centres"
 senegalD3_desc:0 "With our presence in the ivory coast solidified it is time to turn our attention inland. If we acquire the trade centres in the interior we can grow our economy further."
 senegalD4_title:0 "Inland Buffer States"
 senegalD4_desc:0 "Whilst we have made great inroads into the interior, this land is somewhat for us to defend, being so far away from our core land. If we can establish a few buffer states in the interior, it may deter other nations from getting ideas."
 senegalD5_title:0 "Secure the Islands"
 senegalD5_desc:0 "While our control over West Africa is fairly solid, the Europeans continue to harass our trade from their naval bases in the ocean. We need to put a stop to these imperialists once and for all."
